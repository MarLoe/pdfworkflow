Send your documents as PDF via Microsoft Outlook.

# Introduction
On macOS you can "print" to PDF. Among the options you have, is sending the print as PDF using Apple Mail application.

It is however not easy to send the PDF via Outlook if that is the mail application you are using.

This PDF Workflow will give you this option easy and hazzle free.

Later I am hoping to add somthing a bit more automated ;)
